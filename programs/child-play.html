                        <p>Theatre Training Program for 2017</p>
                        <h2>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Information</h2><p>
                          The Child Play program has been running since 2005 when our first production was &ldquo;The Witches&rdquo;, with productions in the July school holidays each year. Other productions have included further Roald Dahl classics such as &ldquo;James and the Giant Peach&rdquo;, &ldquo;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&rdquo; and &ldquo;The BFG&rdquo; in 2015. &ldquo;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&rdquo; was a very popular story and we have decided to perform it again in 2017, which is 50 years after the book was published in Britain. Our productions have been enjoyed by audiences young and old and have also received critical acclaim, with all Child Play productions receiving nominations from the Canberra Area Theatre (CAT) Awards in both the youth play and general categories. Individual actors have also received CAT Award nominations.</p><p>
                          The Child Play program offers participants the opportunity to take part in all aspects of a theatre production, both acting on stage and also learning a variety of back-stage technical skills, including stage management, lighting, sound-effects (both recorded and live), make-up and more. The Child Play program develops the techniques, skills and confidence required to act on stage plus the knowledge required to be a responsible member of the back-stage crew. All participants will be involved in a full-scale theatre production – in a non-threatening and supportive environment.</p><p>
                          The Child Play program is suitable for children between the ages of 10 and 16, with little or even extensive theatre experience. The Child Play program produces plays, not musicals, therefore no singing or dancing experience is required, and is aimed at all children who love theatre, who want to gain experience and build on and share previous stage experiences with others, make new friends and be prepared to have a go, both on-stage and back-stage, as part of a team working towards a great show.</p><p>
                          All productions are directed by Belinda Anyos (BJ), Child Players ACT&rsquo;s Artistic Director. BJ works at Questacon as an &ldquo;Excited Particle&rdquo; and also coordinates the very popular Questacon &ldquo;Science Time&rdquo; program for 2-5 year olds. Other experienced drama tutors/facilitators and Child Play graduate teen helpers will assist BJ with the program in 2017, with technical experts in sound, lighting, etc. running backstage workshops as required.</p><h3>
                          CLASS/REHEARSAL TIMES:</h3><p>
                          The Child Play program will be conducted in Terms 1 and 2 of 1st Semester 2017, beginning on Sunday 5 February. There will be a commitment to one class of four hours per week in 1st term – on Sunday afternoons from 12-4pm at the Downer Community Centre, Frencham Court, Downer. In 2nd term the rehearsals for all participants will still be for four hours on Sunday afternoons with additional targeted rehearsals (ie to rehearse particular scenes with not everyone required) for an additional 2 hours after the main rehearsal. Everyone will therefore be required for 4 hours each week in 1st term and up to 6 hours per week in 2nd term. </p><p>
                          Classes will not be conducted in the April school holidays or Easter, however there will be rehearsals on the Canberra Day and Queen&rsquo;s Birthday long weekends. The program will conclude with a 2-week production in theatre@bcs, Belconnen in the July school holidays 2017. Everyone will be required to be available for this period. <strong>Attendance at all rehearsals is compulsory and it is very important that both children and families do not take on other activities that will clash with Child Play rehearsals. Any possible clashes should be discussed with us before enrolments are finalised.</strong> </p><p>
                          Child Play is a completely nut-free program.</p>
                          <h3>FEES:</h3>
                          <p>
                          The total fee for the six-month Child Play program in 2017 is $520 per participant. Application forms and a deposit of $200 should be returned with the application form, or no later than 7 November 2016, with the balance of $320 payable by 9 January 2017. A payment plan can be arranged if required as long as the full amount is paid by 9 January. No refunds will be payable after that date unless your place can be filled from the waiting list. No refunds can be made after the program commences. A $30 administration fee will apply to all refunds. </p><p>
                          The fees for the Child Play program cover six months of tuition (4 hours per week in 1st term and up to 6 hours per week in 2nd term) plus the two weeks of the July school holidays.</p><p>
                          PLUS, each participant will received a script, a Child Play bag with pencil case and stationery, a folder, a black Child Play t-shirt to be used as their backstage shirt (for new enrollees) and 2 complimentary tickets to a performance of the production. A DVD of the production will be produced and made available to participants. Participants may be asked to provide some personal costume items such as shoes, tights, tops etc. </p><p>
                          It is also not possible to produce the quality theatre productions that Child Players ACT is known for without the assistance of parents. The Child Play program needs to be a commitment from parents as well as the children and there is the expectation that parents will be involved and assist with making costumes, building sets, making and finding props etc. It is important that parents list their skills on the enrolment form and nominate how they will be involved. A couple of working bees will be held in second term. If you can&rsquo;t sew, hammer or paint, there will be opportunities to help with publicity/promotion and assisting at the theatre during the production.</p>
                          <p>
                          There is so much to learn in theatre, so many back-stage jobs, heaps of fun to be had, lots of friends to make and an audience waiting to applaud you. Come and join us. The fun begins on Sunday 5 February 2017.</p><p>
                          There are strictly limited places in the Child Play program for 2017 and early application is essential to secure a place, which cannot be guaranteed until the application form and deposit have been accepted. A deposit of $200 is required with return of the application form and should be forwarded by 7 November 2016. The balance of $320 is to be paid by 6 January 2017. Payment details are on the application form. For further information, and application forms please contact Kathy by email to <a href="mailto:childplayact@gmail.com">childplayact@gmail.com</a>. </p>
