</a>			<p>Hating Alison Ashley is a teen comedy, with a strong moral undercurrent about the pursuit of happiness and perfection, the pressures of growing up and the power of friendship. It portrays the agonies of being a teenager, school-girl rivalries, constant embarrassment by family, and painful and often brutally funny awkwardness and insecurity.</p>

</a>			<p>Child Players Act is expanding our activities in 2010 by presenting a play by the older graduates from the Child Play program. This group is Teen Play and is made up of young people aged 14-19 who have graduated from Child Play and have also had considerable stage experience with other companies and school productions.</p>
<p>The first production by Teen Play is the fantasy play <strong><em>Mort </em></strong>adapted by Stephen Briggs from the book by Terry Pratchett. This exciting new production of <strong><em>Mort </em></strong>is directed by Rob Bunzli who has been involved in Canberra amateur theatre for many years as a Director, Stage Manager and Techie. Rob is assisted by BJ Anyos, the Artistic Director of Child Players ACT.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mort </em></strong> is the fourth book in Terry Pratchett’s <strong>Discworld </strong>series. It tells the story of Mort, a clumsy but good-hearted lad who is rejected as an apprentice by even the town cesspit cleaner until Death arrives at the last minute and offers him a job. While being a very funny play, the image of Death may be a bit daunting for the very young and <strong><em>Mort </em></strong>is recommended for kids 8+, teens and adults and particularly any Terry Pratchett and fantasy fans.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mort</em></strong> will be performed at the Belconnen Theatre, Swanson Court, Belconnen for only seven performances opening at 7.30pm on Wednesday 30 June and continuing at 2.00pm and 7.30pm on 1, 2 and 3 July. All tickets are only $12 with group concessions and can be purchased at the door or booked on 0410 049 834.</p>		</div>

</a>			<p>From 8-17 July 2010, in the school holidays, Child Players ACT’s Child Play Program is presenting a new play adaptation by BJ Anyos of the classic tale of <strong><em>Peter Pan</em></strong> by JM Barrie at the Belconnen Theatre, Swanson St, Belconnen.</p>
<p>The story of the boy who refuses to grow up has had many interpretations on stage and screen. This adaptation by BJ is true to the original book and continues Child Players ACT’s vision of bringing the page to the stage. It will be a fun journey with Wendy, Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Tinker Bell and all their friends and enemies with lots of colour, magic and sword fighting. Suitable for everyone but may be a bit scary for the very young.</p>
<p><strong><em>Peter Pan </em></strong>is the sixth July school holiday production from the Child Play Program kids, following the very popular <strong><em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em></strong> in 2009. Child Play is a unique theatre training program created by B.J. Anyos, the Artistic Director of Child Players ACT. The Child Play program has been running for five years and gives approximately 36-40 children aged between 10-16 the opportunity to learn all aspects of theatre, both on-stage and back-stage. The Child Play participants are formed into two casts (this year the Blue and Green teams) and while one cast is performing on-stage the other cast are undertaking all the back-stage roles that contribute to a quality theatre production including stage management, lighting and sound, props etc. Cast members also provide live sound effects.</p>
<p>There will be a total of 14 performances of <strong><em>Peter Pan</em></strong><em> </em>at the Belconnen Theatre between 8-17 July at 10.30am and 2.00pm on Thursday 8, Friday 9, Saturday 10, Wednesday 14, Thursday 15, Friday 16 and Saturday 17 July. All tickets are still only <strong>$15.</strong> Bookings and enquiries to 0413 139 790. No EFTPOS facilities available at the theatre.</p>		</div>
